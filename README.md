NETWORK COIN X13 [NETC] POW/POS

NETWORKCOIN (NETC) Was created from the beginning and is open source , 
is a new alternative crypto coin that uses X13 algorithm,Why I chose the X13 algorithm rather than SHA256,Scryp-Jane,Scrypt or X11?.
I choose x13 over x11, because everyone is thinking that x11 is the ‘new’ scrypt so i wanted to be different and have something different.
I find that the innovation in NetworkCoin lies in its algorithm, The X13 algorithm is based on the X11 algorithm, but incorporates 
1. more hashing functions and 2. more secure,Networkcoin include both a POW and a POS stage ,In that case once the coins have been mined 
they will increase in value holding an open wallet your computer be online.Max coinbase 400.000 NETC , 
POW mining coins only 80.000,Block Time 60 Seconds ,Reward 5 NETC. Expect more improvements and features to come.
